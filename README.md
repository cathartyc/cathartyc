### Hi, nice to meet you!

I'm Arturo and I like to code, but I actually love to learn new stuff by both looking at documentations and reading other people's *`amazing`* ™️ code.

- 🌱 Currently learning: Rust, Bash
- 🌿 Did something in: C, Java, Python, MATLab, C++
- ❔ Wishlist: LaTeX, Lua, JS (or TS), PHP, AWK, HTML, CSS
